TC: Thing communication 

@buitanan #AnIT
I'm An, i am Vietnamese, i have a problem and decice to design a solution.
Problem:
 - Any device that can connect to internet, for example like camera, it self hard to stream data to user who had another devices like smartphone, laptop, PC.
 To stream video, we had to NAT with internet routers. That is Problem because there are more devices with IoT world, it's complex with any one who do not know about network devices setting
 - HTTP are not fast and secure enough
 - Died connection because firewalls, DDOS, hacking, changed DNS,...
Solution:
 - I tried some new decentralise technologies but they are not complete and hard to use. So i had to made new thing
 - New decentralise system. That can embed to any devices, simple to stream data with secure algorithm
 - Can not stop, cross firewalls, never die because DNS
 - Dynamic domains are not necessary
 - Stream data with any devices with sam protocol and easy to stream to another protocols
